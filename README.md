# client-server-multithreaded-chat-system
This project implements a multithreaded client-server messaging system in C. 
The server handles multiple clients concurrently using threads and maintains message routing between users.
Each client can:
- Send messages to another specific client
- Receive asynchronous incoming messages
- Exit the system gracefully
The project demonstrates socket programming, threading, synchronization, and basic inter-process communication.
